### Image Suggestion

You can use a simple illustration showing:

- Two chat bubbles (representing real-time messaging)
- A user avatar
- A lock (for security/authentication)
- MongoDB and Socket.IO logos

Or, generate a preview screenshot of your chat UI (if available) and save it as `chat-web-preview.png` in your repo.
